This assignment is a custom portfolio website built from scratch as well as an opportunity to put what I've learned into practical use.
Learning CSS and image linking is very useful when it comes to matters of customization, I even figured out how to upload a gif which is satisfying.
I plan to update this page with assignments as they come out as well as possibly some personal work.
